<p><div><b>History of DOF:<br><br><br></b>
The idea to establish DOF was born out of Founder’s own experience. His family lives hundreds of kilometers away from where he live now, and he often struggle to find basic foods like Shiro, honey, butter, and berbere (spiced peppers), which are essential in Ethiopian food culture. As a result, he has to buy these items from nearby shops, but most of the time; these foods are adulterated, which has potential damage on health and test. Thus, the Owner, like many others do has had to rely on his family to prepare and provide him these foods, which can be quite expensive and exhausting. To address these challenges, He has decided to establish a company called DOF which is aimed at processing natural agricultural food and delivers it to users based on their food culture, using digital technology. Since its establishment DOF is working towards this goal for the past two years.
